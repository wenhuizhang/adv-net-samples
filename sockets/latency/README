LatencyCount

Installation
        make 

Usage

Step one: run it in a server.  Protocol can be any cased substring of TCP/UDP.
        ./latency-count -m server -p [port] -s [protocol]

Step two: test and get the result in a client.  The Protocol has to be the same as that of the client.
        ./latency-count -m client -h [server_ip] -p [port] -n [times] -s [protocol]

Special one: test tcp in the same machine by default
        make test_tcp

Special two: test udp in the same machine by default
	make test_udp
